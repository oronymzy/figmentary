## contributing
I welcome any contributions to the Python source code. I am not accepting direct additions to [the YAML file containing stories](storily.yaml), but any freely-licensed, suitably short story submitted elsewhere online (maybe using a hashtag like [#sixwordstory on Mastodon](https://floss.social/tags/sixwordstory)) will be a candidate for inclusion here.
