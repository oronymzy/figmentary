# Figmentary
Display a pseudorandomly-selected, freely-licensed story. Inspired by the [fortune](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortune_(Unix)) program.

| Note:
|:-
| The Python code requires [ruamel.yaml](https://pypi.org/project/ruamel.yaml/).

| Note:
|:-
| The name comes from “[figment](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/figment)” and “[fragmentary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/fragmentary)”.

## contributing
I welcome any contributions to the Python source code. I am not accepting direct additions to [the YAML file containing stories](figmentary.yaml), but any freely-licensed, suitably short story submitted elsewhere online (maybe using a hashtag like [#sixwordstory on Mastodon](https://floss.social/tags/sixwordstory)) will be a candidate for inclusion here.
